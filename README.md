# Shamir's Secret Sharing

A Java implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm to calculate the constant term of a polynomial based on given roots in various bases.

## 🧐 About the Project
This project implements a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm. It allows you to decode roots provided in different bases and calculate the constant term of the polynomial formed by these roots.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.3.5
- JSON library (org.json)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/shamir-secret-sharing.git
   cd shamir-secret-sharing

2 . test case 1 & test case 2
```bash 

      The constant term c for file input1.json is: 3  

      The constant term c for file input2.json is: 263490999
